Release 2.6.6, Dec 7, 2010
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality and reliability.
Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade. See the product
website for a complete description.

Summary of Changes
------------------
For the latest details on the changes, see http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-dctm/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release_2.6.6

  * Fixed issue 54 to allow the r_object_id property to be included on
    the configuration form and indexed.
  * Fixed issue 69 to optionally index the location of documents as a
    property named google:folder. The values are taken from the
    r_folder_path values of a document's enclosing folders. This
    property can be included on the configuration form.
  * Fixed issue 73 to fix DFC_BOF_COULDNT_ADOPT_SESSION errors during
    authorization. This would lead to authorization failures and
    documents missing from the search results.
  * Fixed issue 75 to use &#39; instead of &apos; when escaping single
    quotes. Previously, when adding or editing a connector instance
    using Internet Explorer, if the additional where clause included a
    quoted string and clicking the Save Configuration button returned
    a configuration error, then Internet Explorer would not resolve
    the &apos; entity. This would lead to further configuration errors.

Version Compatibility

    in the Admin Console when the configuration was outdated, such as

---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 1.0.1 through 2.0.2 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager

later. It also uses a new method in DFC 5.3.

Customers upgrading an existing installation from a version 1 release
must stop Tomcat and rename the EMC_Documentum_Content_Server_VERSION
directory, where VERSION is either 5.2.5_5.3 or 6.0, to
EMC_Documentum_Content_Server before beginning the upgrade. This
directory can be found in the WEB-INF/connectors directory of the
connector manager application.

Customers with custom connectorInstance.xml files created for version
1.3.2 or earlier must update those files in order to use the Advanced
Configuration section of the configuration form in the admin console.
Please see issue 52 for details, and contact Google Enterprise Support
if you need assistance.

Release 2.0.0, Jun 15, 2009
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements. Users of previous
releases are encouraged to upgrade. See the product website for a
complete description.

Summary of changes
------------------

For the latest details on the changes, see http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-dctm/issues/list?can=0&q=label%3AMilestone-Release_2.0.0

  * Fixed issue 23 to include the full type hierarchy in the indexed
    r_object_type property.
  * Fixed issue 33 to avoid deleting a document when a version is
    deleted. If the current version is deleted, the new current
    version will be reindexed.
  * Fixed issue 40 to avoid a potential infinite loop if the
    checkpoint method throws a DfRuntimeException.
  * Fixed issue 41 to implement TraversalContextAware. The connector
    now uses the MIME type configuration in applicationContext.xml to
    determine whether to send the document content. The connector
    always sends the metadata, even if the content itself is rejected.
  * Fixed issue 52, moving the root_object_type, where_clause,
    included_object_type, and included_meta properties from the
    connectorInstance.xml file to the configuration form in the admin
    console. This dramatically simplifies common configuration
    scenarios.

designed to function with EMC Documentum Content Server versions

Summary of changes
------------------

  * Fixed issue 26 to avoid an error displaying the configuration form
    when the password was missing.
  * Fixed issue 28 to index metadata only if no content is available,
    or if the content is too large (larger than 30 MB). This also
    supports indexing folders.
  * Fixed issue 31 to use the can_index attribute of the dm_format
    object associated with a document to decide whether to index the
    content.
  * Fixed issue 42 to correctly index repeating ID attributes.

    Previous versions only required Browse permission.

  * Fixed issue 47 to compile the code with debug information.
  * Fixed issue 48 to handle concurrent authentication requests. The

    concurrent requests could lead to errors and the denial of access.
  * Fixed issue 49 to index the canonical google: properties with each
    document.
