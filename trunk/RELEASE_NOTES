Release 3.2.10, March 20, 2015
==============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves security and quality
without adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.8
------------------------
19736255 - Documentum user ACEs should use the user_login_name
           attribute rather than the CN RDN of the user_ldap_dn
           attribute. This is consistent with authentication, which
           uses the user_login_name.

19732599, 15450112 - Group lookup fails and user ACEs are constructed
           incorrectly if the user's user_ldap_dn attribute does not
           contain the user domain.

           A new advanced config property is introduced to support
           this configuration:

           <property name="windows_domain" value="configdomain"/>

           The configured value ("configdomain") is used as the domain
           for all users with no LDAP domain, in ACLs and for group
           lookup. If the primary verified identity (PVI) of the
           search user includes a domain, it must match the configured
           windows_domain value.

19484996 - The connector handles timestamps incorrectly if the
           connector host is in a different time zone from the
           Documentum Content Server. Depending on whether the client
           local time was earlier or later than the server local time,
           the connector would either send the same IDs to the GSA
           repeatedly for adds and deletes, or it would repeatedly
           skip adds and deletes in certain time windows.

17737679 - The connector has an unclosed collection. This may use
           extra resources and may lead to other problems.

13218191 - The Advanced configuration section on the configuration
           form did not load on GSA 7.2 when the Advanced
           configuration checkbox was clicked.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 1.0.1 through 3.2.8 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 3.2.2 or later. Earlier versions of the Connector Manager will
not work correctly with this version of the connector. This product is
designed to function with EMC Documentum Content Server versions 6.5,
6.6 and 6.7, including service packs. EMC Documentum Foundation Classes
(DFC) 6.5 or later is required. Java 6 or later is required.


Release 3.2.8, July 8, 2014

    the connector.

           It was marked as global user, instead of local group.

=============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves security and quality
without adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.2
------------------------
13399766 - Documentum connector SQL and LDAP injection vulnerability
           in group lookup. With a carefully constructed username,
           which must be validly authenticated by the connector or
           another configured authentication mechanism, the connector
           group lookup might return the group membership for a
           different user.

13309424 - Documentum connector leaks a session if group lookup query
           fails.

13253159 - When multiple domains are used, it is possible for the
           Documentum connector to return groups for the wrong user
           when configured for group lookup only.

13109953 - Documentum connector does not support Kerberos realms, DNS
           domains, or uppercase domain names for group lookup.

Version Compatibility
---------------------

Summary of Changes
------------------
For the latest details on the changes, see http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-dctm/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release_2.6.6

  * Fixed issue 54 to allow the r_object_id property to be included on
    the configuration form and indexed.
  * Fixed issue 69 to optionally index the location of documents as a
    property named google:folder. The values are taken from the
    r_folder_path values of a document's enclosing folders. This
    property can be included on the configuration form.

    authorization. This would lead to authorization failures and
    documents missing from the search results.
  * Fixed issue 75 to use &#39; instead of &apos; when escaping single
    quotes. Previously, when adding or editing a connector instance
    using Internet Explorer, if the additional where clause included a
    quoted string and clicking the Save Configuration button returned
    a configuration error, then Internet Explorer would not resolve
    the &apos; entity. This would lead to further configuration errors.

------------------

For the latest details on the changes, see http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-dctm/issues/list?can=0&q=label%3AMilestone-Release_2.0.0

  * Fixed issue 23 to include the full type hierarchy in the indexed
    r_object_type property.
  * Fixed issue 33 to avoid deleting a document when a version is
    deleted. If the current version is deleted, the new current
    version will be reindexed.
  * Fixed issue 40 to avoid a potential infinite loop if the
    checkpoint method throws a DfRuntimeException.
  * Fixed issue 41 to implement TraversalContextAware. The connector
    now uses the MIME type configuration in applicationContext.xml to
    determine whether to send the document content. The connector
    always sends the metadata, even if the content itself is rejected.
  * Fixed issue 52, moving the root_object_type, where_clause,
    included_object_type, and included_meta properties from the
    connectorInstance.xml file to the configuration form in the admin
    console. This dramatically simplifies common configuration
    scenarios.

    when the password was missing.
  * Fixed issue 28 to index metadata only if no content is available,
    or if the content is too large (larger than 30 MB). This also
    supports indexing folders.
  * Fixed issue 31 to use the can_index attribute of the dm_format
    object associated with a document to decide whether to index the
    content.
  * Fixed issue 42 to correctly index repeating ID attributes.
  * Fixed issue 43 to require Read permission during authorization.
    Previous versions only required Browse permission.
  * Fixed issue 45 to add support for Documentum 6.5.
  * Fixed issue 47 to compile the code with debug information.
  * Fixed issue 48 to handle concurrent authentication requests. The

    concurrent requests could lead to errors and the denial of access.
  * Fixed issue 49 to index the canonical google: properties with each
    document.
